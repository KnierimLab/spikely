Overview
========

When recording from extracellular electrodes, **spike sorting** is needed to separate the activity of individual
neurons, or units. However, there are many different file formats for recording data
and several spike sorting algorithms available. This usually results in
custom-made codes to parse the data and set up a specific spike sorting software.

spikely is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to make the analysis of
extracellular electrophysiology data easy and accessible without any recording
experience. spikely interfaces with many different file formats and allows the user
to run many popular, semi-automatic spike sorting algorithms. It also allows
users to preprocess their data with a variety of common functions and to curate
the sorted result.
